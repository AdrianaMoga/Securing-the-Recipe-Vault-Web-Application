Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Security Vulnerabilities

Critical:
- MFA is not enabled for the "root" account, root account access key exists
- RDS instances are public
- root user access key is available
- IAM policies that allow full "*:*" administrative privileges are not created
- Bitbucket source repository URL contains username and password, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.

Medium:
- AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is not enabled 
- S3 bucket don't have encryption enabled 
- IAM password policy is not set
- The VPC default security group allow inbound and outbound traffic

Low:
- Web instances has one process listening on TCP port 22, which is associated with SSH service and is reachable from the internet 
- Instance i-09a2e3cff55622b29 is configured to allow users to log in with root credentials over SSH, without having to use a command authenticated by a public key. This increaseS a successful brute-force attack.
 

Recommendations
- Hardware MFA should be enabled for the root user
- RDS DB Instances should prohibit public access
- IAM root user access key should not exist
- Bitbucket source repository URLs should use OAuth
- CodeBuild project environment variables should not contain clear text credentials
- no security group allows unrestricted ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22 and 3389
- MFA should be enabled for all IAM users that have console password
- S3 buckets should have server-side encryption enabled
- S3 Block Public Access setting should be enabled
- IAM password policy requires at least one lowercase letter and at least one symbol
- Password policies for IAM users should have strong configurations
- Application Load Balancer should be configured to redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS
- The VPC default security group should not allow inbound and outbound traffic
- Configure EC2 instances to prevent root account logins over SSH. Disable SSH root account logins.
