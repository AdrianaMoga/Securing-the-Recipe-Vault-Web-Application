# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.

1. UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce

- GuardDuty is monitoring on port 22 and finds that one of my EC2 instance was involved in SSH brute force attacks.
- 10.192.11.161 is performing SSH brute force attacks against i-09a2e3cff55622b29. Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.
- This can indicate an unauthorized access to AWS resources.

Remediation Recommendations:
- securing SSH port to only trusted IPs through Security Groups, ACLs, or firewalls


2. UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/RDPBruteForce

- An EC2 instance has been involved in RDP brute force attacks.

This finding's severity is low if your EC2 instance was the target a brute force attack. This finding's severity is high if your EC2 instance is the actor being used to perform the brute force attack.
This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment was involved in a brute force attack aimed at obtaining passwords to RDP services on Windows-based systems. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources.

Remediation Recommendations:
- securing all ports to allow only trusted IPs through Security Groups, ACLs, or firewalls


3. Other suspicious traffic from VPC flow logs:

-- UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorClient
	Your EC2 instance is making connections to a tor guard or an authority node.

Default severity: High

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is making connections to a Tor Guard or an Authority node. Tor is software for enabling anonymous communication. Tor Guards and Authority nodes act as initial gateways into a Tor network. This traffic can indicate that this EC2 instance is acting as a client on a Tor network. A common use for a Tor client is to circumvent network monitoring and filter for access to unauthorized or illicit content. Tor clients can also generate nefarious Internet traffic, including attacking SSH servers. This activity can indicate that your EC2 instance is compromised.

If this activity is unexpected, your instance is likely compromised, see Remediating a compromised EC2 instance.

-- UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorIPCaller
	Your EC2 instance is receiving inbound connections from a tor exit node.

Default severity: Medium

This finding informs you that an API operation (for example, an attempt to launch an EC2 instance, create a new IAM user, or modify your AWS privileges) was invoked from a Tor exit node IP address. Tor is software for enabling anonymous communication. It encrypts and randomly bounces communications through relays between a series of network nodes. The last Tor node is called the exit node. This can indicate unauthorized access to your AWS resources with the intent of hiding the attacker's true identity.

-- UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/TorRelay
	An EC2 instance is making connections to a tor network as a tor relay.

Default severity: High

This finding informs you that an EC2 instance in your AWS environment is making connections to a Tor network in a manner that suggests that it's acting as a Tor relay. Tor is software for enabling anonymous communication. Tor relays increase anonymity of the communication by forwarding the client's possibly illicit traffic from one Tor relay to another.
