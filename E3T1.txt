- GuardDuty was able to identify SSH brute force attack based on VPC flow logs collected by S3 bucket (cand-c3-vpc-flow-logs-264312323152). 

- It is a security monitoring service that analyzes and processes many data sources: VPC Flow Logs, AWS CloudTrail event logs and DNS logs.

- In this case, it was monitoring port 22, capture the traffic from VPC network interface and finds that one of my EC2 instance was involved in SSH brute force attacks. 
Instance 10.192.11.161 was involved in SSH brute force attacks against i-09a2e3cff55622b29.


Remediation Recommendations:
- Securing SSH port, allow only trusted IPs, disable authentication with user and password.
