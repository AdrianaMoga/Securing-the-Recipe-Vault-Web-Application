# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

1. ## Scan infrastructure as code templates

- CFripper is a Python tool that aims to prevent vulnerabilities from getting to production infrastructure through vulnerable CloudFormation scripts.
CFripper is part of the CI/CD pipeline
It runs just before a CloudFormation stack is deployed or updated and if the CloudFormation script fails to pass the security check it fails the deployment and notifies the team that owns the stack.

Reference: https://pypi.org/project/cfripper/0.7.1/

### Example vulnerability
